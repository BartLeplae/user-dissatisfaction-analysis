# user-dissatisfaction-analysis
Analyze the reasons why users respond 'dissatisfied' in the incident resolution survey

## Installation

## Project motivation
For about 10% of the incident tickets, users enter a satisfaction survey.
For about 10% of the surveys, the users provide a 'dissatisfied' score

Questions:
1. Are there specific ticket attributes that correlate with the ratio of 'dissatisfied' responses?
2. Can the expected ratio of 'dissatisfied' reponses for subsets of tickets (e.g. based on ticket resolving group, application, ...) be predicted based on a regression model?
3. Is there a difference between the predicted satisfaction ratio's for tickets that have and don't have a survey response?
